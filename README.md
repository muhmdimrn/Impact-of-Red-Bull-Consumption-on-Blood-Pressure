# Impact-of-Red-Bull-Consumption-on-Blood-Pressure
## Objective:
The primary objective of this analysis is to evaluate the impact of consuming Red Bull on blood pressure among different groups of volunteers. The analysis will focus on the following specific goals:

1. Determine the Overall Impact of Red Bull on Blood Pressure:
- Analyze the change in average blood pressure before and after consuming Red Bull to determine if there is a significant overall effect.
  
2. Assess Gender Differences in Blood Pressure Response:
- Compare the changes in blood pressure between male and female volunteers to evaluate whether gender influences the effect of Red Bull on blood pressure.
  
3. Investigate Age Group Variations in Blood Pressure Changes:
- Examine the effect of Red Bull on blood pressure across different age groups to identify any age-related trends or patterns.
  
4. Identify the Proportion of Volunteers Experiencing Increased Blood Pressure:
- Calculate the percentage of volunteers whose blood pressure increased after consuming Red Bull to understand the consistency of the effect.
  
5. Analyze the Relationship Between Initial Blood Pressure and Changes Post-Consumption:
- Explore whether volunteers with higher initial blood pressure are more likely to experience significant increases after consuming Red Bull.
